        My name is Luke, I'm a 19 year old aspiring software developer. I've been using computers my entire life, almost daily, and constantly strive to learn new things online.
        I was born and raised on teamwork; my childhood was a series of sports teams in a large variety, cooperation comes naturally. I'm really tired and my mind is just
        blanking on how I should finish this so I'll stick with whatever comes to my mind first. Imagine there's some riveting story here about how I got interested in coding,
        and that I saved the world or something with it.
